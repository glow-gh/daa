# Evaluation

The present module presents the participant evaluation procedure of the [Digital Applications in Assyriology Nordic Summer School 2022](https://glow-gh.github.io/daa/). The evaluation will comprise two elements

## Introduction
The evaluation procedure will be comprised by two elements, namely an open discussion between participants and staff reviewing the experience of students and teachers as relates to the execution of the course programme, and an evaluation form completed online via the Uppsala University survey bot [KURT](https://doit.medfarm.uu.se/bin/kurt3/), to be completed at the end of the second week after submitting the written assignment.

### Open evaluation
Friday 5 August 13.00-14.00 CEST

The initial evaluation will take the form of a round-table discussion with students and present staff, allowing both groups to offer opinions and observations on the course programme.

1. Please consider and raise any points about the application and response process May-July 2022. Did you experience any issues in terms of timely information, response from staff or similar?

2. Please consider the course programme as executed during the week 1-5 August 2022. What elements did you particularly like? Where could the programme be improved, practically and in terms of content? Anything in particular that you would like to see included in future instalments?

3. What kind of follow-up, if any, would you consider helpful in enabling you to build on the skills that you have acquired during the summer school?

### Evaluation form
To be submitted by Friday 12 August via [KURT](https://doit.medfarm.uu.se/bin/kurt3/) (link to follow)
