# Assignment Workshop
This module introduces an open workshop for planning your written assignment that concludes the summer school programme, to be prepared and delivered by Friday 12 August. 

## Introduction
The assignment is intended as an exercise in the definition, description, and evaluation of a simple application of digital tools to Assyriological data. As such, you should focus on definition and documentation of the digital approach and developing your workflow. Choose a _very simple topic_ for this assignment. You want to focus on developing basic computing skills, not on substantive research questions
