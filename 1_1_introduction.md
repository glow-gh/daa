# Introduction
The Digitial Applications in Assyriology Nordic Summer School 2022 is organised by staff at two major research projects, namely [Geomapping Landscapes of Writing (GLoW)](https://www.lingfil.uu.se/research/assyriology/glow/) at Uppsala University and [Ancient Near Eastern Empires (ANEE)](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/ancient-near-eastern-empires) of the University of Helsinki. We have also received  further financial support from the [Ancient Middle Eastern Nordic Network (AMENN)](https://ccrs.ku.dk/education/amenn/), an educational network with the aim to further student exchange in Assyriology, Egyptology, and Middle Eastern Archaeology in Scandinavia.

This module will introduce the teaching staff, participating students and programme of the [Digital Applications in Assyriology Nordic Summer School 2022](https://glow-gh.github.io/daa/), along with practical information regarding your stay at Uppsala University from Monday 1 August - Friday 5 August. It will also provide some initial directions on the aims of the course programme, how you should approach the individual course modules, preparing for the written assignment, and the future use of the skillset that you will acquire.

## About the summer school
From the outset, it is important for us to stress that this summer school is a first for participating students _and_ the teaching staff. While all members of the teaching staff are experienced in using a variety of digital applications in their research, teaching digital applications can be very different from using them. As such, we will all, students and staff alike, be learning from this exercise - and we are all bound to encounter errors or misunderstandings along the way.

We should also make clear that one week is sufficient to provide you with a good overview of the various computing applications that can be employed in Assyriological study and research, but far too little to supply you with sufficient expertise in all aspects of the use and deployment of these applications. In order to reap the full benefits of this summer school, we will encourage you to develop further the skills that you have acquired by using the applications that you have been introduced to on your own. From our own experience, we can safely say that nothing that we know about digital applications in research has come without regular and continued use of these tools, and so we strongly recommend that you continue to use and learn about these applications after the summer school has ended.

## Tasks

* [Previous training in digital applications](#previous-training-in-digital-applications)
* [A review of the course programme](#a-review-of-the-course-programme)
* [What do you expect to gain from the course programme](#what-do-you-expect-to-gain-from-the-course-programme)
* [Initial information about written assignment](#initial-information-about-written-assignment)

### Previous training in digital applications

We will start out by soliciting responses from the participants as to previous training received in the use of digital applications for research. The points below give some examples:

* Editing text
* Working with tabular data
* Using databases
* Statistical analysis and visualisation
* Spatial data and maps

### A review of the course programme
We will then review the course programme for the week, and offer some brief comments on the structure and intended learning progression underlying the arrangement of individual course modules.

* Course modules
* Application drop-in
* Afternoon talks

### What do you expect to gain from the course programme

As this is the first time that we are organising this summer school, we will be interested in your input throughout the duration of the programme.

*  How do you find the selection of applications introduced?
* Are there any particular applications or approaches that you are interested in, and for any particular reasons?
* Are there any particular applications or approaches that you find missing or would like to see added?

### Initial information about written assignment

On Friday 5 August, we have alloted two hours for drafting and planning your written assignment (see [5.2 Assignment workshop](./5_2_assignment.md)). The written assignment is part of the course programme, and should demonstrate your ability to deploy one or more of the applications that you have been introduced to in addressing simple tasks of data collection, manipulation, and presentation. 

* 3-5 written pages, excluding appendices with data employed
* Assigment paper should contain definition of aims, methodology, and intended outcomes
* Assignment paper should cover process of data collection, processing, analysis and presentation

Please start thinking already now about a small and simple project that you would like to do for this assignment, and keep it in mind as you go through the course modules during the week. Teachers will happily provide input when available outside classes, and we will also have the chance to work out a more comprehensive assignment plan on Friday.
