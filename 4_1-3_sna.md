# Social Network Analysis

## Introduction
This course block is designed to introduce the main concepts of **Social Network Analysis** (SNA) in particular, and the relevance of network science for studying the ancient past in general. Through a hands-on tutorial, we will also familiarise ourselves with **_Gephi_** - a freely available network analytical software that comes with a myriad of tools and measurements for exploring, visualising and analysing network data as network models. By completing the course, you will thus gain a basic understanding of what SNA is, what it can be used for and how you can go about conceptualising, preparing and analysing network data in _Gephi_.

Following an [opening lecture](#task1) on (S)NA, its relevance for historical and archaeological research and the _Gephi_ software, we will:
* consider how we can [extract and model data for SNA from an ancient text](#task2) (in groups)
* [acquaint ourselves with the case study and dataset](#task3) to be exploring (provided by lecturer)
* complete a [hands-on tutorial](#task4) in _Gephi_ (individually)
* and reflect on the exercises and relevance of SNA for studying the (distant) past in a [plenary discussion](#task5)

##### Applications
* [_Gephi_](https://gephi.org/) - the network analytical software we will use

##### Resources
* Suggested reading: [Ch. 6](./_files/Graham_et_al_2016.pdf) of Graham, S., Milligan, I., & Weingart, S. (2016). _Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian's Macroscope_. London: Imperial College Press, pp. 195-234 - a digestable introduction to SNA.
* Network analysts use many technical terms, that can be both overwelming and confusing as one first approaches the methods. To keep track of the concepts, you might find glossaries, like this [list of technical terms](./_files/Tambs_na_glossary.pdf), handy.
* See also [further readings](#furtherreadings), if you want to learn more.

## Tasks
In preparation of the course, please
* install the latest version of [_Gephi_](https://gephi.org/) on the computer you will bring to the summer school. You may also install the software during the 'application dropin' slot on Wednesday 03.08.22.
* download the [4.1-3_SNA zip folder](./_files/4.1-3_SNA.zip), containing the translation, practical exercises and datasets you will need to complete them. To practice your newly acqired skills, you may prefer to access the files through _GitHub Desktop_ (explained in the [1.2 GitHub](./1_2_github.md) section).

If you have questions or run into problems, you are welcome to contact Lena (lena.tambs@helsinki.fi).

### <a id="task1">Introduction to SNA and _Gephi_</a>
The SNA module will start with a lecture introducing the main concepts of SNA and showcasing some examles of how SNA has been used in archaeology and ancient history.

### <a id="task2">Extracting data for SNA from an ancient text</a>
After we have gained an basic understanding of what SNA is and what it can be useful for, you will try extracting network data from an ancient marriage contract in groups. For this conceptual exercise, you will read [P. Rylands Dem. 20](https://www.trismegistos.org/text/135) in translation (see _Tambs_daa_sna_TM_135.pdf_ in the [4.1-3_SNA zip folder](./_files/4.1-3_SNA.zip)) and brainstorm ways to represent it as  network graphs (consisting of dots and lines, often called **nodes** and **edges** in network jargon) using old-fashioned pen and paper.

### <a id="task3">The case study and dataset to be explored</a>
Next, we shall scale up from the document to the archive the text is associated with, and see what characterises the social network model you will each be exploring in the hands-on tutorial.

The case study is an interpersonal network extracted from the private family [archive of Pelaias, son of Eunous alias Nechoutes](https://www.trismegistos.org/arch/detail.php?arch_id=180), who lived in the Upper Egyptian town and military camp of [Pathyris](https://www.trismegistos.org/place/1628). The archive consists of thirty Greek, demotic and bilingual documents written on papyri and ostraca in the late 2nd and early 1st cent. BCE.

### <a id="task4">Hands-on tutorial</a>
For the second practical exercise, you will follow the hands-on tutorial _Tambs_daa_sna_tutorial.pdf_ (in the [4.1-3_SNA zip folder](./_files/4.1-3_SNA.zip)).

The [zip folder](./_files/4.1-3_SNA.zip) also includes three .csv-files (_Tambs_daa_nodes_, _Tambs_daa_edges_1_ and _Tambs_daa_edges_2_). They contain the datasets you will use to create and analyse a social network model in _Gephi_ (as explained in the tutorial).

### <a id="task5">Plenary discussion</a>
After we have tried using the _Gephi_ software to visualise and analyse our network, the SNA module will be concluded by a plenary discussion on the potential and relevance of SNA for our field(s) of study.
