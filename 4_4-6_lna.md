## <a id="intro">1. Introduction</a>

This course block introduces the idea of using networks to explore relationships between **words** rather than people, in an approach called **Lexical Network Analysis (LNA)**. This module will introduce you to the concept of **word co-occurrence**, the probabilistic measurement called **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)**, and the analysis of networks built from co-occurrence data in Gephi.

The course will begin with a [lecture](#4.4_lecture) to explain the key elements of LNA, and how it differs from SNA. During the module, we will:

* introduce the basic idea of [word co-occurrences](#4.4_lecture)
* explore which [layouts and network weasures](4.5_layout_words) work best for lexical networks
* compare [words](4.5_layout_words) in a case study lexical network
* compare results with [two other lexical networks](4.6_othernetworks_plenary)
* Use [Korp](4.5_layout_words) to explain the patterns found in the network

## <a id="tasks">4. Tasks</a>

### <a id="4.4_lecture_task">What is LNA, word co-occurrence, and examples of LNA</a>
* Download the [PMI example zip file](./_files/PMIexample.zip). This includes the pmizer2 script, list of target words, and dataset.

### <a id="4.5_layout_words_task">Looking at layouts and investigating individual words</a>
* Install the latest version of [**Gephi**](https://gephi.org/) on the computer you will bring to the summer school. You may also install the software during the ‘application dropin’ slot on Wednesday 03.08.22. If you have participated in the SNA module, you should already have Gephi installed.
* download the [LNA examples zip file](./_files/LNA_animals.zip) and extract the files. If possible, check that all the Gephi files will open in Gephi prior to the session.

### <a id="4.6_othernetworks_plenary_task">Comparing with other networks and plenary discussion</a>

## <a id="module">5. Module Structure</a>
There will be three parts to this module, each about an hour long. After each module we will have a short 5 minute break so you can stretch your legs.

### <a id="4.4_lecture">What is LNA, word co-occurrence, and examples of LNA</a>
We will begin with a [short lecture](./_files/4.4-6_LNA_opening_lecture.pdf). This will introduce the concept of building networks based on relationships between words. This will include a brief look at word co-occurrence methods, and some examples of how LNA has been used in Assyriological and other ancient texts.

We will then look at the worfklow of LNA to understand the steps needed in building a lexical network. This will include:
* a critical look at the dataset we will use
* an introduction to the probabilistic measurement Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
* use PMI to find the co-occurrences of the Akkadian words for lion, cat, and bull.

Finally, we will talk about what we need to do when we want to find the PMI co-occurences for more than three Akkadian words.

### <a id="4.5_layout_words">Looking at layouts and investigating individual words</a>
In this section, you will begin exploring a pre-prepared lexical network. In the first half hour, you will split into groups and play with the layout of the network. You will be exploring which layout algorithm seems to display the network best. You will also be changing the size and colour of the nodes based on network measurements. This will help you grapple with how lexical networks based on PMI are different from social networks.

In the second half hour, your group will be assigned a word to look at in your network. You will use the network to find patterns surrounding the assigned word, and then learn how Korp can help explain the patterns. An example complex search based on the PMI parameters can be found [here](XXKORP HERE).

### <a id="4.6_othernetworks_plenary">Comparing with other networks and plenary discussion</a>
In the final section, we will compare your network with two others: 
* [A network based on all Akkadian words (except proper nouns) in a dataset of first millennium texts on ORACC.](https://kielipankki.fi/tools/demo/anee/anee-portal-first-millennium-non-proper-2022-05-swapped/index.html)
* [A network based on all Akkadian words (except proper nouns) in a dataset of Neo-Assyrian texts on ORACC.](https://kielipankki.fi/tools/demo/anee/anee-portal-neo-assyrian-all-non-proper-2022-05-swapped/index.html)

We will end with a plenary discussion about the pros, cons, and potential for this method in Ancient Near Eastern studies.

##  <a id="furtherreadings">6. Further readings</a>
Co-occurrence networks in historical documents is a relatively new development of Network Analysis as a field. However, if you are interested in using this method for future research, this is a selection of articles and books we have found useful. You can download them as a [.zip file on the Github pages](./_files/4.4-6_LNA_further_reading_pdfs.zip).
